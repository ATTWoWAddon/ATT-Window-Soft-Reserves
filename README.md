## Features
- Manage Soft Reserves via whisper or by having your raid & guild members use the addon themselves.
- Soft Reserve data is sent to/from players in your group so that everyone sees the same thing. (Addon required)

## Why do I need this addon?
- This addon adds the Soft Reserves window to ATT. The window can help your raid manage Soft Reserves as well as Soft Reserve Persistence. The soft reserves are shown on the tooltip of items along with any persistence the player has on that item. The extension itself is fairly light weight and does not force you to loot anything in any particular way.

You can open the window using /attsr and either leave it open to have it restore or close it to open again at a later date! As with all other ATT Windows, it will recover back to its last known state on reload or relog!

## Release Schedule
New builds will generally only include updated TOC versions and bug fixes when Blizzard breaks something.
